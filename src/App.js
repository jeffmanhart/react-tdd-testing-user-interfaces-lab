      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a software tester by trade for the last 12 years.  
        After being laid off, I thought this was my time to go back to school to learn more technical skills.
        I have enrolled in Faltiron School courses and will soon be ready to be a developer or a software development engineer in test.
